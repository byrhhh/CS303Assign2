# CS303Assign2
had some trouble with my linkedlist class, I implemented all the function to the best of my abilities but I could not get the code to run. I have a node.h to declare the node class and linkedlist class. I also created a linkedlist.cpp file and that is where i defined all of the functions required for the assignment.

I was able to create my stack of vectors succesfully. I have a stack.cpp & stack.h file. I called the stack functions in the main, I have attached screenshots of the error I kept getting as well as screenshots implementing a stack.
